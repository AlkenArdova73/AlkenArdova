# AlkenArdova
Hi, my name is Alken Ardova. I'm a Mathematics student at Diponegoro University interested in Data Analytics, education, and entrepreneurship.  In the past three years, I've started my entrepreneurship journey by building a startup known as PGA (@pakgurualken). PGA is an educational platform that has helped thousands of high school students to make it easier for them to face the selection test at the university level. Supported by @jehianps  Currently, I'm active as a member of several organizations, such as AIESEC in Semarang as Accounting Manager, Mathematics Student Association as Head of Research &amp; Science Department, and TEDxUNDIP 3.0 as Media Partner Staff of the Marketing Division.  I'm looking forward to being a professional Data Analyst who is able to answer company needs, such as processing, managing, analyzing, and also being able to visualize data. With enough experience I have, it doesn't stop me from trying to learn so that I can develop even better.
